                <h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>
                <p>This type of chocolate contains a higher percentage of cocoa solids and a lower amount of sugar
                    compared to other types. It typically has a more intense and slightly bitter flavor profile. Dark
                    chocolate is known for its potential health benefits due to its higher cocoa content.</p>

                <h3>Milk Chocolate</h3>
                <p> Milk chocolate is made by adding milk powder or condensed milk to the chocolate mixture. It has a
                    creamy and sweet taste, thanks to the added dairy components. Milk chocolate is generally milder in
                    flavor compared to dark chocolate and is a popular choice for candy bars and desserts.</p>

            <div class="type-col">
                <h3>White Chocolate</h3>
                <p>White chocolate is technically not a true chocolate because it does not contain cocoa solids.
                    Instead, it is made from cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids. It has a smooth, buttery texture and
                    a sweet flavor with hints of vanilla. White chocolate is often used in confectionery and baking.</p>
