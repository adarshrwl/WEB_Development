            <h3>White Chocolate</h3>
            <p>White chocolate is technically not a true chocolate because it does not contain cocoa solids.
                Instead, it is made from cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids. It has a smooth, buttery texture and
                a sweet flavor with hints of vanilla. White chocolate is often used in confectionery and baking.</p>
